# Earthquakes 

This is an application for iOS that allows you to consult information on earthquakes recorded on earth.
 The user will be able to adjust his searches by focusing on a region, period or intensity.
 The results of the searches are displayed on a map, and the inspector details each event individually.
 All terms describing events are defined in a glossary.
